# Titanic-EDA
Exploratory data analysis of titanic data. The data set is from kaggle. Open the ipython notebook to see the analysis.

## Questions I am trying to answer 
- How age affected the survival rate ?
- How the socio-economic class affected the survival rate ?
- Which gender has more surival rate ?
- If female survival rate is higher, how does it vary from socio-economic class ?
